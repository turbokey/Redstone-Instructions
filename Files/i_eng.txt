1) Make the base. The lever is placed as shown in the picture: on the side of the lilac block
2) Place 18 sticky pistons
3) Another 3 sticky pistons are placed next to the lever. Everywhere we put redstone torches, and above the blocks to which we put these torches are building another row of blocks
4) Above these blocks place 7 more sticky pistons directed upwards
5) Close all this with blocks
6) Draw a signal from the lever
7) Building the second row. The repeat, which is closer, delay 1, and the other - 4
8) On the other hand, we do everything the same way
9) Draw a signal from the lever to the remaining pistons
10) Place another block, to it conduct a signal through two repeaters (at first delay 4, for second -1) and redstone dust
11) On the other hand, start to build as shown in the picture
12) Do not forget about the halfblock
13) Place redstone dust and repeaters (all have a delay of 4)
14) Another repeater (delay 1)
15) Place 3 sticky pistons
16) Place 3 blocks and 2 slime blocks
17) Building the last, fourth "wall" of blocks and obsidian. Important !: next to a block of mucus must necessarily be obsidian!
18) Activate the lever. It should be as shown in the picture
19) Now close the block mechanism. All is ready
